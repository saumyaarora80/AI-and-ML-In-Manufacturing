AI and Machine Learning are giving manufacturers an unprecedented ability to skyrocket throughput, optimize their supply chain, and accelerate research and development.
Since the rise of the internet, the worldâ€™s top-producing factories have digitized their operations. Now, terabytes of data flow from almost every tool on the factory floor, giving organizations more information than they know what to do with.
Unfortunately, many companies lack the resources to translate this information to reduce costs and increase efficiency. For that, companies need Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
